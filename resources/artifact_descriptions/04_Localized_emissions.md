To estimate carbon flows, we assign a carbon stock value to each LULC class. For example, forests typically store more carbon than meadows or settlements.
Table 1 shows the carbon stocks of each LULC class.
These carbon stocks encompass soil and vegetation carbon, providing an average measure of carbon stored per hectare.
Our method thus compares LULC and its associated carbon stock at the start of the time period with LULC and its associated carbon stock at the end of the time period, i. e. we subtract the associated carbon stock of the end from the carbon stock of the start.
The resulting emission factors are shown in Table 2.
Positive emission values indicate carbon emissions, negative emission values indicate a carbon sink resulting from the LULC change.

It is assumed that each location experiences maximally one LULC change during the analysis period.
Emission factors are only available for the LULC change types given in Table 2.
All other LULC change types are in the unknown class.
The emission factors only account for emissions caused by vegetation removal (e.g. clearing of forest for urban development).
They do not include subsequent emissions caused by e.g. construction of buildings.
With respect to this, real emissions will thus be higher.

The carbon stock value for settlement is a combination of the soil carbon value 60 tonnes/ha (Bradley et al., 2006) and vegetation carbon value 11 tonnes/ha (Strohbach & Haase, 2012).

## Pie Chart: Change areas by LULC change type [ha]

This pie chart shows the total change areas by LULC change type [% of total change area] in the observation period.
The total change area is the total area of all LULC changes for which an emission factor is available.
The slices of the bar chart are colored according to the emissions per pixel of the respective LULC change type.
Since it has the highest carbon emissions per pixel, the LULC change type "forest to built-up" is colored in the darkest red.
Accordingly, the LULC change type "built-up to forest" is colored in the darkest blue, because it has the highest carbon sink per pixel.

## Table: Carbon stock values per class

The table contains the class definition and the carbon stock value for each class according to the selected GHG stock source.
For the emission estimation, you can choose between three different sets of carbon stock values: (1) Carbon stock values from the BLUE model (Hansis et al., 2015), (2) higher carbon stock values from Hansis et al. (2015) based on Reick et al. (2010), and (3) carbon stock values from a database of the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (Houghton & Hackler, 2001).

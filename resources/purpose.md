The purpose of this tool is to estimate carbon emissions from land use and land cover (LULC) change, given a selected area of interest and observation period.
The tool provides maps of the LULC classification at the beginning and at the end of the observation period, as well as maps of the LULC changes.
Additionally, tables and plots with information on the LULC change areas and LULC change emissions are produced.

The purpose of this plugin is to estimate carbon emissions from land use and land cover (LULC) change, given a selected area of interest and observation period. The plugin provides maps of the LULC classification at the beginning and end of the observation period and maps of the LULC changes. Additionally, tables and plots with information on the LULC change areas and LULC change emissions are produced.

The purpose of this operator is to calculate carbon emissions from land use and land cover
(LULC) change, given an area of interest and a certain observation period. The operator
provides geotiffs of the LULC classification at the beginning and at the end of the
observation period, a geotiff showing the LULC change carbon emissions in t/ha, and two
CSV files with statistics such as LULC change area by change type, emissions by change
type, total net emissions, total gross emissions, total carbon sink, and total change
area. It also provides a Geopackage file with the emissions per hectare and the absolute
emissions of each LULC change.
